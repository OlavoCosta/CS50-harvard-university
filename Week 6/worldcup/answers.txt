Questions:

Which predictions, if any, proved incorrect as you increased the number of simulations?:
TODO: None of the predictions turned out to be incorrect, all were successfully executed within the approximate limit.

Suppose you're charged a fee for each second of compute time your program uses.
After how many simulations would you call the predictions "good enough"?:
TODO: After simulation number 100000, because the number of simulations is highly considerable and the program runs for less than 1 second.
